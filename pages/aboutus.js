            <p>
              MBD Boulevard goes beyond the traditional
              marketplace model by offering a wide range of
              goods and services. There are several platforms
              for trading art-based NFTs, but fewer for real
              world goods, services, and loyalty programs.
              Imagine a platform where Fiverr, Etsy, and
              Amazon are all available in one place, anyone
              can set up their own store, and transactions
              occur instantaneously and securely.
